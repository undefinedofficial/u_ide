A-Coder is an open-source AI-powered code editor, forked from Void.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. A-Coder sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for A-Coder. If you're new, welcome!

## Recent Features & Fixes

### 🎯 MCP Server Modal (NEW!)
**Feature:** Custom React modal for managing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, replacing the native VS Code QuickPick.

**UI Improvements:**
- Modern popout modal positioned at top-right corner (near server icon)
- Lists all connected MCP servers with status indicators
- Shows tool count for each server
- "MCP Marketplace" footer button for easy settings access
- Click outside or press Escape to close

**User Experience:**
- Click the server icon in sidebar toolbar to open modal
- Visual status indicators (green = connected)
- Quick access to MCP server management
- Seamless integration with existing settings

**Implementation:** Modal uses service-based communication between VS Code actions and React components for clean separation of concerns.

### 🚀 Morph Fast Apply Integration (NEW!)
**Feature:** Intelligent code application using Morph's Fast Apply API to enhance the Apply functionality.

**What is Morph Fast Apply?**
- Uses Morph's AI to intelligently apply code changes
- Better at handling ambiguous or incomplete code snippets
- Preserves existing code style and formatting
- Graceful fallback to standard apply if Morph fails

**How It Works:**
1. LLM suggests code changes in chat
2. Click the play button (▶) to apply
3. If Morph is enabled, changes are processed through Morph API
4. Code is intelligently applied to your file
5. Visual diff shows changes with accept/reject options

**Setup:**
1. Go to Settings → Feature Options → Morph Fast Apply
2. Toggle "Enable Morph Fast Apply"
3. Enter your API key from [morphllm.com/dashboard](https://morphllm.com/dashboard)
4. Choose model: `morph-v3-fast`, `morph-v3-large`, or `auto`

**Integration Points:**
- Works with code blocks in chat (play button)
- Works with Apply tool calls from LLM
- Uses official `@morphllm/morphsdk` package
- IPC channel to electron-main for SDK execution

**Details:** See [MORPH_FAST_APPLY_INTEGRATION.md](./docs/MORPH_FAST_APPLY_INTEGRATION.md)

### 🤖 Enhanced Agent Auto-Continue (IMPROVED!)
**Feature:** Smarter detection of when LLM has finished vs. when it's waiting for user input.

**Improvements:**
- **Analysis Completion Detection**: Stops auto-continue when LLM presents findings (e.g., "Based on my analysis...", "Here's what I found...")
- **Completion Question Detection**: Stops when LLM asks follow-up questions (e.g., "Would you like me to explain any specific part?")
- **Multi-Indicator Logic**: Uses multiple patterns to detect completion states

**Problem Solved:**
- Before: Agent would continue after complete analysis, causing empty response errors
- After: Agent correctly stops when LLM finishes explaining or asks questions

**Result:** More reliable agent execution with fewer unnecessary continuations and no more empty response errors.

### 🗜️ TOON Tool Result Compression (NEW!)
**Feature:** Reduce LLM token usage by 30-70% with TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) compression for tool outputs.

**What is TOON?**
- Compact JSON-like format that removes unnecessary whitespace and quotes
- Preserves structure while drastically reducing token count
- Especially beneficial for local AI models with limited context windows

**Example:**
```
JSON:  {"files": ["a.ts", "b.ts"], "count": 2}  (45 chars)
TOON:  {files:[a.ts,b.ts],count:2}              (27 chars, 40% savings)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 30-70% token reduction for directory listings, lint errors, and structured outputs
- ✅ More context available for your code
- ✅ Faster responses with local models
- ✅ Intelligent compression (only applies when beneficial)

**Usage:**
1. Open A-Coder Settings → Feature Options → Tools
2. Enable "Use TOON format for tool results"
3. Tool outputs automatically compressed when it saves ≥10% tokens

**Details:** See [TOON_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./TOON_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### 🖼️ Vision Support (NEW!)
**Feature:** Upload images to chat via drag & drop or copy/paste. Images are processed by a dedicated vision model to generate descriptions that work with ANY LLM.

**Architecture:**
- Vision is a separate feature with its own model selection
- Images processed by vision model (GPT-4V, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.)
- Descriptions appended to user message
- Main chat LLM receives text-only message (works with non-vision models!)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with ANY chat model (GPT-3.5, Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- ✅ User controls which vision model processes images
- ✅ Cost optimization (use cheaper vision models)
- ✅ Universal compatibility

**Usage:**
1. Enable "Vision Support" in Settings → Feature Options
2. Select your preferred vision model
3. Drag & drop or paste images into chat
4. Images are analyzed and descriptions added to your message

**Details:** See [VISION_SUPPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./docs/VISION_SUPPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

---

### 📬 Message Queue Visual Indicator (NEW!)
**Feature:** Clear visual feedback when messages are queued while LLM is running.

**UI Improvements:**
- Shows banner: "X message(s) queued"
- Displays hint: "Enter to send queued message (⏎)"
- Updates input placeholder dynamically
- Real-time count updates

**User Experience:**
- Before: Silent queuing, user confusion
- After: Clear visual feedback, user knows exactly what's happening

---

### 🚫 Empty Message Filter (FIXED)
**Issue:** LLMs sometimes returned empty responses showing as "(empty message)" in chat.

**Fix:** Filter out empty assistant messages before rendering in UI.

**Result:** Clean chat history without "(empty message)" clutter.

---

### ✅ Ollama Cloud Tool Calling (FIXED)
**Issue:** Ollama Cloud models were returning `500 unmarshal` errors when using native tool calling.

**Root Cause:** Our tool schemas were missing `type` fields, causing llama.cpp's JSON schema parser to fail.

**Fix:** Updated `sendLLMMessage.impl.ts` to include `type: 'string'` in all tool parameter schemas.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed! All Ollama Cloud models now use native OpenAI-style tool calling.

**Details:** See [OLLAMA_CLOUD_TOOL_CALLING_BUG.md](./docs/OLLAMA_CLOUD_TOOL_CALLING_BUG.md)
